For streamline routing by adding middleware
Public routes can only be accessed without authToken, If a user wants to access a private route, he must have authToken

Also, understand the app routing through this practice project.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
